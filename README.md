# Intership Project: Learn To Build A Real Time Gen AI Customer Service Bot

# Task 3: Multi-Modal Chatbot (Text and Image Analysis)

### Introduction
This project focuses on extending the functionality of a chatbot to handle both text and image content using advanced AI models like Google Palm and Gemini AI. The chatbot is designed to accept and process textual queries, generate intelligent responses, and analyze user-uploaded images to provide contextual and seamless interactions. This combination of textual and visual understanding enhances user experience and demonstrates the potential of multimodal communication in real-time customer service applications.

### Background
Traditional chatbots primarily rely on natural language processing to handle text inputs and provide responses. However, with the advent of multimodal AI models like Gemini AI, it is now possible to process multiple input types, including images. Incorporating image analysis into chatbot functionality opens up possibilities for better, more dynamic customer support, where visual information is often critical. This project aims to leverage these capabilities to create a chatbot that integrates both textual and visual understanding.

### Learning Objectives
* Integrate Google Palm and Gemini AI for multimodal capabilities.
* Develop a system that can accept and analyze image inputs from users.
* Generate relevant and intelligent textual responses based on image content.
* Enhance the user experience by combining text and image-based interactions.

### Activities and Tasks

* Activities Performed:

* Integrated Google Gemini AI to handle multimodal inputs (text and image).
* Enabled the chatbot to analyze and respond to user-uploaded images via Streamlit’s file uploader.
* Combined text and image-based interactions to provide more contextual and relevant responses.

* Technologies Used:

* Programming Language: Python
* Framework: Streamlit for the web-based interface
* AI Tools: Google Gemini AI API for multimodal analysis
* Image Processing: PIL (Pillow) for handling image inputs
